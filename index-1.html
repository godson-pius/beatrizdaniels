                                <p>Beatrizdaniels_foundation was birthed as a revelation received from God by the Founder of the foundation as captured in James 1:27 , which states that: “Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their trouble, and to keep oneself unspotted from the world” (NKJV)

                                    Beatrizdaniels_foundation is an NGO focused on alleviating the plight of widows and orphans. We design and execute programmes that give financial independence and educational opportunities to widows, their children and orphans.</p>

                                <p>A journey which started on the 23rd of May 2008 with three (3) widows, has amalgamated into a network of almost a thousand widows today. Since its inception, Beatrizdaniels_foundation has directly impacted the lives of more than 4,262 widows through vocational skills and awarded scholarships to 1,971 widow’s children as well as 322 orphans.

                                    Beatrizdaniels_foundation loans that are given to widows are interest free and the scholarships have no conditions attached. The foundation has also made available residential/business accommodation for 73 (61 widows and 12 orphans). Furthermore, in collaboration with our partners, Beatrizdaniels_foundation has provided free healthcare consultations and legal services to our widows.

                                    Beatrizdaniels_foundation works to provide spiritual strengthening, comfort and encouragement to widows, their children, orphans and the neglected in society.
                                    
                                    Our board of directors comprises of people who possess integrity, professionalism excellence and achievements. Our work is produced by faith as well as labour that is prompted by love and endurance which is inspired by hope. </p>

                                <p>Background:

                                    Beatrizdaniels_foundation embarked on its expansion drive to reach widows, their children and orphans across Nigeria. In spite of the insecurities in some states, the foundation has continued to achieve its goal of empowering widows, their children and orphans in each geo-political zone of the country. Those empowered are benefitting from life-changing interventions provided by the Beatrizdaniels_foundation.
                                    
                                    This initiative is born out of the benevolence of its Founder, <!--Mrs. Folorunso Alakija,--> who aims at addressing the long-term needs of widows, their children and orphans, empowering them for a brighter future.</p>
